# University Project With Django And React

This project consists of four team members overall devided into two teams of two in frontend and backend.
We will use Django to provide apis for reaching out to business logic and database and also use reactjs library for client side.
In Bellow and up comming parts of this readme file you will find pre requests to run projects in client and server side ,
All models , use cases and methods used in project.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (version X.X.X)
- Npm (version X.X.X)
- Django (version Y.Y.Y)

# Getting Started

## Preparing the backend side
a)  Clone the repository
```shell
git clone  https://github.com/pooya-dehghan/educational_ministry_irp
```

b) Navigate to the project directory:
```shell
cd educational_ministry_irp
```
c) Create a virtual environment to isolate project dependencies locally

```shell
python -m venv <name of your virtualenv>
example:
python -m venv my_env
```
- we can install virtualenv package to create it too. use this command

```shell
python -m pip install virtualenv
```
- after installing virtualenv use this command for creating your virtual environment

```shell
virtualenv <name of your environment>
example:
virtualenv my_env
```
d) activate your virtual environment
- windows
```shell
<name of your environment>\Scripts\activate
example:
my_env\Scripts\activate
```
- linux:
```shell
source <name of your environment>/bin/activate
example:
source my_env/bin/activate
```

## After activating the virtual environment you should see the name of your environment behind the path of your application. like the below image:
![Screenshot of my cmd](img/my_env.PNG)




e) Install the dependencies(Backend side)
- notice that your virtual environment should be active while installing
- using backend_requirments.txt file in the repo:
```shell
pip install -r backend_requirments.txt
```


f) navigate to the backend folder(directory)
```shell
cd backend
```

g) now you can run the backend server with this command:

```shell
python manage.py runserver
```

- you should see a message in your command line or terminal like this:

![Screenshot of my cmd](img/runserver.PNG)


h) If you want to see the output, open the browser and search for this address
```shell
http://localhost:8000
or
http://127.0.0.1:8000
```

# migrate
you have more than 20 unapplied migrations. so you can not use the admin panel or database. 
- this command applies all unapplied migrations.
```shell
python manage.py migrate
```

# superuser
- To access the admin panel to manage users and materials, create a superuser:

```shell
python manage.py createsuperuser
```
- Follow the prompts to enter your desired username, email, and password.

- Go to http://localhost:8000/admin/ â†— and log in with your superuser credentials.

# Backend Views
As a back-end developer, here are some of the key views and endpoints that you'll want to be aware of:

- school/api/v1/list/: This endpoint returns a list of all schools in the system.
- school/api/v1/<int:pk>/: This endpoint use for create update and delete a school in the system.
- student/api/v1/list/: This endpoint returns a list of all students in the system.
- student/api/v1/<int:pk>/: This endpoint use for create update and delete a student in the system.
- accounts/api/v1/registration/: endpoint for user registration.



- accounts/api/v1/jwt/create/ endpoint is typically used for creating access and refresh token
- /accounts/api/v1/jwt/refresh/ endpoint is used for refreshing user access tokens
- accounts/api/v1/jwt/verify/ endpoint is used for validating user tokens.
- accounts/api/v1/login/ : this endpoint is for login :))))

# Install the dependencies(client side):


```shell
cd educational_ministry_irp
npm install
```



```shell
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX
```

Access the API at http://localhost:XXXX/XXXX/XXXX
